# BonnMotion
A mobility scenario generation and analysis tool

BonnMotion is a Java software which creates and analyzes mobility scenarios and is most commonly used as a tool for the investigation of mobile ad hoc network characteristics. The scenarios can also be exported for several network simulators, such as ns-2, ns-3, GloMoSim/QualNet, COOJA, MiXiM, and ONE. BonnMotion is being jointly developed by the Communication Systems group at the University of Bonn, Germany, the Toilers group at the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA, and the Distributed Systems group at the University of Osnabr√ºck, Germany. Several mobility models are supported, namely

 * the Random Waypoint model,
 * the Random Walk model,
 * the Gauss-Markov model,
 * the Manhattan Grid model,
 * the Reference Point Group Mobility model,
 * the Disaster Area model,
 * the Random Street model,
 * and more.
